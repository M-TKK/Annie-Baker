          <h1>Cadence Is a Dance</h1>
          <h5>9th February 2021</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="bp-body">
          <p>
            By definition, cadence is the rhythmic flow of a sequence of words or sounds. For me, it is a
            neglected aspect of writing. An important, almost alchemical element. The correct cadence in
            your poem or book can leave your reader feeling satisfied, akin to eating a good meal when the
            subtle flavours melded together to make it exceptional. And like the meal, there are many other
            elements that need to come together, particularly in a story, for the reader to have that
            experience. For poetry, I feel its rhythm can be more musical. Some might call it lyrical. That
            said, it can still follow a symphonic pattern.
          </p>

          <p>
            Therefore, music and storytelling are remarkably similar, with the cadence of a story being
            likened to a symphony. It rises and falls in a kind of push and pull rhythm relating to the
            challenges and clashes of the protagonist and the antagonist. This then builds to a grand finale, a
            point of final tension where things are resolved, or lead into book two if one is writing a series.
            Think of musical pieces such as the Bolero by Ravel or Lark Ascending by Vaughan Williams.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            In a story, the cadence reflects the theme and individual characters. It is the energy of those
            characters that contribute to cadence along with the ebb and flow of scenes. The reader needs to
            resonate with the principal characters, and they should elicit both positive and negative feelings.
            For instance, the villain or antagonist might have a disjointed, distasteful rhythm. Maybe his or
            her thought processes are disjointed, obsessive or psychotic, depicted by their dialogue and
            thoughts. Perhaps their actions are narcissistic, violent, and unpredictable. The villain should
            unsettle the reader, especially in psychological and crime thrillers. But even in other story
            genres, the villain must push the reader out of their comfort zone. Of course, the villain’s
            appearance, back story, goals, obstacles and setting all contribute to the overall cadence of the
            character and their story arc.
          </p>

          <p>
            Your protagonist, or hero, needs to meet challenges – blockages – from the antagonist, or
            unexpected circumstances, to create tension. Overcoming those challenges releases tension,
            restoring flow and feelings of relief for the reader. The protagonist is also never perfect. That is
            unrealistic and two-dimensional. Although they might have certain gifts and skills, they must
            also have faults, thus creating tension and a varied cadence. How the protagonist meets and rises
            above his, or her, challenges will make them a hero in the reader&#39;s mind. Above all, whether
            protagonist or antagonist, the reader must be able to identify with them.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a writer, I need to get a feel for the overall ebb and flow of my story before I begin a rough
            outline. Much like I get a feel for my client’s ‘Chi’. Although I’m a more intuitive writer,
            planning is still an important aspect of my approach to story writing. Regarding my poetry,
            however, I focus strongly on how I feel about something important to me and the words almost
            find their own rhythm and flow.
          </p>

          <p>
            Think of something that moved you. Feel its rhythm and see what you come up with and what
            you associate with that feeling. Does it have a colour, sound or texture? Does it have a light or
            heavy quality?
          </p>

          <p>
            Think of a story premise and the principal character. Imagine their traits and feel the energy of
            that character. How will their personality drive the rhythm of the story?
          </p>

          <p>
            Would love to hear what you come up with so leave me a message.</p>
